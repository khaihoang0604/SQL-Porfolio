# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my SQL projects, showcasing my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project includes detailed SQL scripts and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

# Dataset Details
