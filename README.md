# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my SQL projects, showcasing my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project includes detailed SQL scripts and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

## Projects

- **Project: Adaventure Works Cycles**
  - **Description**: This project involves cleaning and transforming [raw company data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-69OzW3RjLf-opUtUxRd_Ejf1vJ8_sJi/view?usp=share_link) to prepare it for analysis. The dataset contains standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer (Adventure Works Cycles). Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management,Contact Management, and Human Resources.
  - **SQL Skills Used**: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Type Conversion, Handling Missing/Incorrect Values.
